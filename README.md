# Communitywise Patient data project
 # Scenarios Resolved by the Model:

## 1. Healthcare Resource Allocation:
For planning healthcare resources, such as doctors, medications, and preventive measures, our model aids in calculating averages of patient counts, disease categories, and pharmacy inventory data. It helps identify communities with high patient numbers and spikes in specific diseases, enabling prompt allocation of extra help and supplies to those in need.

## 2. Environmental Impact on Health:
Our model facilitates understanding of how air quality affects community health by analyzing data on air quality and fine particulate matter and correlating them with health statistics. It alerts health departments to sudden increases in air pollution alongside rises in respiratory cases, prompting actions to improve air quality and issue health advisories. Additionally, it aids in arranging supplies like masks and asthma pumps to mitigate health impacts.

# Explanation of Scenarios Addressed by Pivot Table Solution:

## 1. Trend Analysis:
Utilizing trend analysis, we can identify patterns in health statistics, pharmacy stock levels, and environmental factors over time. This enables proactive planning and informed decision-making.

## 2. Comparative Analysis:
The pivot table solution organizes data as needed, facilitating comprehensive analysis. It allows for comparisons of health statistics across different communities, assessment of pharmacy inventory levels, and evaluation of environmental factors. This helps pinpoint areas requiring attention, directing resources where they are most needed for maximum impact.

# Forecasting to Enhance the Solution and Address Future Scenarios:

## Enhancing the Solution with Forecasting:
Forecasting provides insights into future values of variables, aiding in resource arrangement. In our solution, forecasting predicts patient counts and air quality, enabling health officials to proactively allocate resources.

### Predictive Scenarios:

1. **Resource Planning:**
   Forecasting predicts future patient counts and disease trends. For example, if a surge in lung disease cases is forecasted for the upcoming season, health officials and pharmacy vendors can stock up on relevant medications and schedule additional staff to handle the influx of patients.

2. **Environmental Management:**
   Predictions on air quality and its impact on health can assist municipality and government pollution control departments. Forecasting changes in air quality and particulate matter levels allows for the implementation of measures like stricter emissions regulations or public awareness campaigns to mitigate health risks.
